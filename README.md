# educational-testing

This is the body of code handed down to me used for student pre-tests and post-tests that I made to resemble the Canvas LMS.

I created all styling, added pagination, and am responsible for all JavaScript/jQuery.

I added the scroallable question selection window, added the ability to flag questions using svg-image sprites, manipulated fonts in the font-awesome library to create the Canvas-like question-mark and check-mark icons, and added browser responsiveness.

Please feel free to fork this project and please make suggestions as we are all lifelong learners.
